# --- Bayesian Update Parameters ---
# These control how categorical Vs30 values are updated using observations.

# Effective number of prior observations (n0 in Bayesian formulas).

# DBSCAN clustering parameters for handling spatially clustered observations.
# Geotechnical investigations often produce clusters of measurements (e.g., along roads).

min_group: 5

# Maximum distance (meters) between observations to be in the same cluster
# (DBSCAN epsilon parameter). Points further apart will be in separate clusters.
