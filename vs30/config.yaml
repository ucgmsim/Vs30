# --- Full New Zealand Land Extent Bounds (for coastal distance calculations) ---
# IMPORTANT: These values define the full extent of New Zealand land coverage
# and MUST NOT be changed. They are used to ensure coastal distance calculations
# are computed on the full NZ land extent, regardless of the configured study
# domain bounds (grid_xmin/max/ymin/max above). This is critical because:
# 1. Observations used in MVN spatial adjustment may fall anywhere within NZ
# 2. Coastal distances must be accurate for all observation locations
# 3. Computing distances only on a small domain leads to incorrect values for
#    observations outside that domain, causing errors in MVN calculations
# These bounds match the legacy _full_land_grid() function behavior

# --- General Configuration ---

# Whether to perform Bayesian update of geology and terrain categorical vs30 values
do_bayesian_update_of_geology_and_terrain_categorical_vs30_values: true

# Maximum distance (meters) for considering observations in MVN spatial adjustment.
# Observations further than this distance from a pixel will not influence its update.
max_dist_m: 10000

# Maximum number of observations to consider per pixel during MVN update.
# Using the closest observations improves computational efficiency while
# maintaining accuracy (observations far away have minimal influence anyway).
max_points: 500


# Covariance reduction factor for dissimilar Vs30 values (dimensionless).
# Controls how much the correlation between two points is reduced when their
# model Vs30 values differ. Higher values = more reduction for dissimilar values.
cov_reduc: 1.5

# Whether measurements are "noisy" (affects noise weighting in MVN update).
# When true, observations with higher uncertainty contribute less to pixel updates.
noisy: true

# Correlation length parameters (phi) in meters.
# Phi represents the distance at which spatial correlation decays to ~37% (1/e).
# Larger phi = smoother spatial interpolation, smaller phi = more localized updates.
# These values were calibrated for New Zealand geology and terrain data.
phi_geology: 1407
phi_terrain: 993

# Maximum memory in GB for spatial boolean arrays during chunked processing per process.
# Note: Total process memory usage will be several GB more than this limit
# due to raster data, observation arrays, and other data structures.
# When using parallel processing (n_proc > 1), each process uses up to this amount.
# See docs/spatial_processing_optimization.md for benchmarking results.

# Observation subsampling step for find_affected_pixels when using clustered observations.
# When observations are spatially clustered, nearby observations affect the same pixels.
# Using every Nth observation (e.g., 100) significantly reduces computation time
# while producing nearly identical results for the affected pixel mask.
# Set to 1 for no subsampling (use all observations).
# Only applies to clustered observations; independent observations always use step=1.

# --- Bayesian Update Parameters ---
# These control how categorical Vs30 values are updated using observations.

# Effective number of prior observations (n0 in Bayesian formulas).
# Lower values give more weight to new observations, higher values are more conservative.

# Minimum standard deviation (log-space) allowed after Bayesian update.
# Prevents over-confidence when many observations are available.

# DBSCAN clustering parameters for handling spatially clustered observations.
# Geotechnical investigations often produce clusters of measurements (e.g., along roads).
# DBSCAN groups nearby measurements so each cluster contributes approximately once
# to the Bayesian update, preventing over-weighting of densely sampled areas.

# Minimum number of observations to form a cluster (DBSCAN min_samples parameter)
min_group: 5

# Maximum distance (meters) between observations to be in the same cluster
# (DBSCAN epsilon parameter). Points further apart will be in separate clusters.
